                    <p className='primary'>Minting crypto is the process of generating new coins by authenticating data, creating new blocks, and recording the information onto the blockchain through a “proof of stake” protocol. These tokens can then be used to represent different things, such as digital collectibles, gaming assets, or real-world assets.</p>
